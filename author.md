<p>My name is Andres Kütt and I've spent the past few decades building software for living. </p>
<p> Started out as a programmer and gradually transferred into leadership and architecture roles. The latter has led me to think and write about technology strategy: how technology-dependent organisations function, how does it all fit with the ideas of Enterprise Architecture and so forth. </p>

<p> The best way to really understand something is to attempt to teach that something. This is what I do here in a hope that it benefits you, dear reader, as much as it does me. </p>
