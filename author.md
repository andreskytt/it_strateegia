<p>My name is Andres Kütt and I've spent the past few decades building software and helping others do it§. </p>
<p> I started out as a programmer and gradually transferred into leadership and architecture roles. The latter has led me to think and write about technology strategy: how technology-dependent organizations function, how does it all fit with the ideas of Enterprise Architecture and so forth. </p>

 <p> The best way to really understand something is to attempt to teach that something. This is why I have been teaching IT Strategic Management at Tallinn University for the past few years. This blog serves as a sort of pressure vent where I write down things I'd like to understand better. I it benefits you, dear reader, as much as it does me. </p>
