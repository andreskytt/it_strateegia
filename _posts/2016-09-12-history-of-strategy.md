## The Art of War
The concept of strategy as we recognize it today surfaced in the military in the 18th century. The word _strategos_ means a 'general' in greek and for long time strategy was seen as a purely military concern.

When talking about military strategy and history, there is no way getting around Sun Tzu and his Art of War. Master Sun lived between 544 and 496 BC. Or so we think: he is one of those figures who has become a symbol, an idea, almost entirely detached from any physical reality. The 25 centuries separating us have allowed plenty of mighty generals and thinkers to reflect on his work. Thus make sure you get a copy with as thorough commentary as possible - the comments are definitely worth reading as are comments on comments. 

One of the commentators has been Freedman who points out, that Sun Tzu is all about being smarter than the other guy. A ruse can, however, fail and, if both parties would follow his teachings, a dance-like stalemate would ensue. Also, even a half-competent adversary would probably not be easily tricked repeatedly. The Art of War is, however, very much applicable today. Since a large portion of strategic thinking is focused around winning[^1], let's use his thoughts on the topic as an example.

According to Sun Tzu, there are five essentials for victory:

 1. __He will win who knows when to fight and when not to fight__. Basically, pick your fights. It is neither desirable nor possible to turn every fight to your favor at all cost
 1. __He will win who knows how to handle both superior and inferior forces__. Another timeless thought reflected by many contemporary authors. Strategy must be dependent on the context and the competition. Also, the initial assessment of relative strength can be incorrect. A cornered weakling might fight back harder, than expected while a giant might cause chaos falling over
 1. __He will win whose army is animated by the same spirit throughout all its ranks__. Peter Drucker has said 'Culture eats strategy for breakfast'[^2]. This statement is probably best testament to timelessness of the Art: every few months another starry-eyed entrepreneur emerges who has just discovered the importance of culture. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a successful organization without shared values and beliefs
 1. __He will win, who, prepared himself, waits to take the enemy unprepared__. Here Freedman's critique becomes obvious: if both parties wait hoping for a situation the other is not prepared for, will there be a resolution? In some sense the first point about picking fights is repeated but Master Sun also seems to point to the need to behave unexpectedly and thus to differentiate oneself[^3]
 1. __He will win, who has military capacity and is not interfered with by the sovereign__. Here an age-old question of the relationship between politics and military is set up. In our context, between the CEO and the CIO. There is much debate on the topic (we will come back to it, undoubtedly) and no definitive truths but one ignores this relationship at their own peril


__Key point:__ There is no neat truth to be learned. The fundamental questions of strategy have been discussed since very early days and continue to be subject to heated arguments and much writing

## The managers
How military strategy has developed since ancient times is something that Freedman discusses in depth in his "Strategy: A History", discussing it here would do little but distract us from the topic of IT strategy. 

Management as an academic topic got started with establishment of Wharton School in 1881. Harvard Business School was established in 1908. The latter sorely exposed a rift between the "proper" sciences and something that was initially seen as little more than a set of practical tools for keeping workers from revolting and the bureaucracy ticking over neatly. An escape was seen in the approach of one Frederic Winslow Taylor, who sought to improve operational efficiency of industry. The works and ideas of Taylor do not need much introduction. It is probably sufficient to say that his approach was said to be the only teachable system of management at the time. 

This was important as HBS got ingrained with Taylorism and the field of management in turn got heavily influenced by Harvard. The thing is that strategy as such is not entirely coherent and logical. It certainly has bits that are quantifiable[^4] but, as in life, not all important things are measurable and not measurable things are important. This problem of improving measurable things, i.e. operational efficiency, being mistaken for management finally prompted Michael Porter in 1996 to write his well-known article titled "What is strategy"?[^5]. The rift is not fully healed even now as there are disputes between the economists and strategists with no clear position even as to these two should be converging[^6].

In that landmark work Porter pointed out the futility of participating in the "race to the bottom" or, even worse, mistaking doing so for implementing a strategy. According to Porter, OE is achievable via implementation of practices which disseminate with relative ease. Thus best practices emerge and simultaneously cease to be a strategic differentiator and a profit driver. 

__Key point:__ Treating management in general and strategy in particular as an exact science is not only futile but dangerous potentially narrowing one's focus beyond reasonable.

## Raise of strategy
Although what essentially constitutes strategy had been taught in business calls previously, it was not until the 60s the field took the shape we know today. The trigger was that US companies had reached the limits of expansive growth. The regulations started to prevent further consolidation and the organizations grew too large and complex for common sense to apply. Thus a newly found focus on profitability emerged. It was no longer sufficient to just sell more things to new customers or buy competitors to grow, more subtle techniques were needed. Therefore, much of the early strategic thought is directed inwards, into the internal workings of the organization and issues like competition are not often discussed. For us, this important as this is essentially the focus of the CIO. Issues like market position, competitive advantage and, say, regulatory perspectives certainly influence CIOs strategic decisions, but usually they lay outside of our domain of responsibility. 

In the 70s strategy really started to flourish with specialized consulting shops and professional societies appearing. Rumelt et al[^6] identify three driving forces behind this:

 1. __Hostility and instability of the environment__. Remember the oil crisis? It was in the 70s when the world became sufficiently globalized for simple planning to stop working. Therefore, ways of dealing with the unexpected and taking advantage of it, were needed
 1. __Emergence of marketable analytic tools and concepts__. For example, he Boston Consulting group was a pioneer offering well-defined tools like the 'experience curve' to frame complex issues
 1. __Maturing of corporations__. Top management started to perceive their responsibility as managing a portfolio of businesses whose managers in turn were forced to be able to formulate their plans and goals in a coherent way embracing both internal and external challenges

The 80s saw the research of 70s struggle to find theoretical frameworks for empiric studies. Both the researchers and practitioners could see that certain things worked while others did not but had very little coherent idea as to why this was. Much of the lacking theory was provided by the economists and so, driven by Porter and others a resource-based view of the firm emerged[^6].

Looking back on the development of the field, the drive to define a theory explaining complex issues is clearly evident. However, it is also clear that individual fields like economics or, say, organizational behavior can not provide that theory. A practitioner of strategy must therefore have a good understanding of all key fields influencing their particular line of practice and be able to synthesize their own theories and concepts.

__Key point:__  Strategy is an interdisciplinary field where practitioners need to be able to correlate theories and concepts from a wide range of disciplines to form a basis for effective action

[^1]: As our friend mr. Freedman points out, people tend to overly fixate on the idea of being able to "win". In a modern complex world it is increasingly difficult to subdue the enemy with a decisive blow. The reason might be that doing so would simply lead to a nuclear inferno (think cold war) or that the enemy lacks any fixed embodiment (think ISIS). Being able to wait, form coalitions and refrain from attacking are unheroic but essential skills of a good strategist
