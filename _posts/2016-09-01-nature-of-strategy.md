## Sir Lawrence Freedman
An inconceivable amount of text has been produced about strategy and, yet, there is no clearly
dominant school of thought in the field. There is not even an established definition of what strategy _is_
and so oftentimes what gets passed for strategy has little resemblance to the subject[^1]. 

Therefore, before we proceed further into the topic, it would probably make sense to provide some context, some explanation of the underlying approach taken here.

One of the most influencial authors in this regard is sir Lawrence Freedman (check out his lecture [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-R7kjNT8hkI)). And he tells us that this diversity of thought makes sense.
Strategy, in his perspective, is all about discussing choices. The choices themselves, could be based on a wide variety of
disciplines and approaches but, from the perspective of strategy, what matters is why we picked one choice over the other,
why we were not aware of other choices etc.[^2]. The question of the decision-making process can be difficult to distinguish from the decisions and 
so the question of "what is strategy" can easily get muddled.

Still, it would be comforting to have more shape to our subject. Aren't there areas where these decisions are more strategic in nature? De Kluyver and Pearce, Rumelt et al produce a list (there are others but they all boil down to more or less the same) of key strategic choices all organizations face[^3]:

 1. __Goals__ What is the direction the organization is moving towards and, therefore, what direction it is _not_ moving[^4]
 1. __Position__  How does the organization position itself in product-markets and how is this position maintained
 1. __Scope and diversity__ Given the goals and market position, what range of products/services we offer and what is the level of diversity in the portfolio?
 1. __Coordination__ The design of organizational structure, administrative systems and policies used to define and coordinate work. Basically, how 
do we manage our resources and make sure work gets done

These do not necessarily sound like profound, fundamental issues in need of deep strategic thought. In some way or another these are key questions 
we ask ourselves every day. Indeed, Freedman makes an observation that this is natural: that tactics and strategy are only distinguished by 
the organizational position of the person concerned. I.e. it really does not matter how strong an impact your decision has or what time horizon is concerned. Everybody is making strategic decisions all the time, whether they realize it or not. 

__Key point:__ Strategy is more an art of making decisions first than the art of what decisions to make.  

## Dynamics of strategy
Oftentimes the concept of a strategic plan surfaces: the organization is supposed to have a clear strategic goal and a well-defined list of steps of attaining that.
This is very much an engineering mindset, they love to figure out solutions to complex problems. We need to go to the moon, we'll figure out how and then execute. 
The trouble with this approach is that the moon does not try to run away. Or as the classics say
<blockquote>
  <p>
	Everyone has a plan ’till they they get punched in the mouth
  </p>

</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  <p>
	No plan survived contact with the enemy
  </p>
  <footer><cite title="Helmuth von Moltke the Elder">Helmuth von Moltke the Elder</cite></footer>
</blockquote>


And thus a fundamental property of strategy is highlighted, its dynamic nature. Strategy is always rooted in the position, capabilities and resources of an organization. But these tend to change as the strategy gets executed and as the world turns. The idea is not to achieve some mystical goal but to move away from a situation that is for some reason 
undesirable. To solve a problem. Also, strategy does not end when the goals have been achieved. After the revolution, one needs to govern. A takeover is followed by the need
to build a common organization

<blockquote>
  <p>
	Strategy is not a three-act play. It’s a soap opera
  </p>

__Key point:__ Strategy is dynamic in nature, any static representation of it is only valid at a specific point in time.
 
## Mental models
Chances are your organization is not a special snowflake, that others are facing the same challenges you are. Thus, that soap opera does not take place in a vacuum, others are struggling alongside. Which means that, following Freedman's logic, it is about the ability to control future to a larger extent than the competitors can. 

How does one control the future? First of all, there is the need to be able to predict it. Hawking (and many others before him) has observed that we are only capable of perceiving
the outside world via a mental model [^5]. The nerve impulses traveling from our hand only become meaningful in a context: we need a mental model to tell us that we have placed
our hand close to a heat source and should probably be withdrawn. Our model of the world, built on experience and learning, tells us that our hand is going to get hurt. Hawking goes on to argue, that, while there are many possible mental models (one for each of us), their merit lies in their predictive power - a more capable model allows to make more accurate predictions and thus be more successful. Indeed. Although two separate models (one postulating that the earth is round while the other claiming it to be flat) can explain why a ship disappears behind the horizon, only one of them can accurately calculate how much longer it is visible from a tower as opposed to the beach.

<blockquote>
  <p>
	A side note. In a social context, a highly predictive model is not necessarily a boon. Giordano Bruno had an excellent model of how the world works but ended up 
prosecuted anyway. 
  </p>
</blockquote>

Thus, organizations need a way to think of the world that allows more accurate predictions than the one the competitors employ. Especially in times of rapid changes, such a model can 
provide a significant advantage. Senge [^6] provides a detailed example of how Royal Dutch/Shell was able to adopt a more accurate world-view and could thus outmaneuver the competition during the oil crisis of the 70's. 
One crucial point he makes while telling the story is that development of such a model is a social process. I.e. it is as much about somebody being able to impose their model onto others than it is having that model. Freedman makes a similar observation stating that the gift of a great strategist lies in their ability to convince others of their insights and what is implied by the way of action.

<blockquote>
  <p>
	Plans are worthless but planning is everything

__Key point:__ Strategy is only as good as the underlying mental model the organization has.
