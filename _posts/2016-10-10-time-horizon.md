## Sustainability
Given the ubiquity of the term, one would hope sustainability is well understood. It really isn't. Wikipedia tells us that sustainability is the endurance of systems and processes. Which, while certainly true does not tell us all that much. The universe, for all we know, is not infinite and is rather certainly limited in time. So is sustainability fundamentally impossible?

Of course not. It's just that idea always comes bundled with some notion of time. For how long can we keep something up? 

In agile development, the term is rather explicitly defined as including time.  As "sustainable pace" is a pace the team can keep up for the foreseeable future. Indeed, there is a difference between the amount of time we can see in the future and the time we care about. Usually we can see much closer into the future than our interests reach[^1]. 

Our fixation and problems with sustainability[^2] do not stem from the fact that some people are behaving in an unsustainable manner, but from the different time horizons people have. The guy focused on his next paycheck will cut a tree a person with the future of humanity in mind would leave be. 

In the long term, we are all dead. So where do we get our time horizons from? 

__Key point:__ Sustainability is all about time horizons

These are the Vitruvian principles engineers have honored for thousands of years. Especially the first one is something the good ones keep in mind. We like to build durable things that last. After all, isn't this the way to maximize the value the thing can deliver over its lifetime? 

Yes and no. Building durable things is expensive and how much do we need it to last anyway? What's our time horizon? Differences in what is considered sustainable, or what our respective time horizons are,  can be a major source of conflict between IT and business organizations, therefore it would make sense to try to understand, what are some of the things that might make the business look much closer into the future than we'd like.

The following is by far not an exhaustive list and is based on personal experience and logic: your mileage may vary. These are some key factors driving the time horizons of organizations[^3] leading to decisions on bonus packages, option plans and financial planning.

 * __Capital structure__ Basically, where does the money come from and when does it need to go back there with interest? How much equity is involved and of what kind? What are the maturity dates of your bonds? That sort of thing. It has an especially important effect on people concerned with financial matters and not necessarily the technical folks
 * __The notion the stakeholders have of "value"__ The goal of an organization is to deliver value to stakeholders, owners among them. And the owners can have vastly different views on what "value" means. A publicly traded company rarely sees further than the next earnings call simply because of the way value for shareholders is defined. Nevertheless, alignment with the time horizons of whoever represents the stakeholders is implied. People usually frown on dumping nuclear waste to lakes despite these activities being (possibly) financially sensible in the short run
 * __Stability of the environment__ The more unstable the environment, the harder it is to predict the future and the shorter your visibility. Note, that there is no concrete measure for "stability", this is all estimates. Thus, it is perfectly normal for different people have vastly different notions of how much change the future is going to bring 
 * __(Implied) strategy of the organization__ Are we participating in a sprint or a marathon? Both are perfectly valid sports but which one are we participating in right now? Distance to the goals we have set ourselves either as individuals or as organization is going to severely impact the way we spend resources and the horizon of our plans 
 * __Shared horizon of the members of the organization__ For a twenty-something next year is distant future while a person in their 40s might be planning for retirement. Somebody with low commitment levels might expect to work for someplace else within a few months as other spend lifetimes chipping away on cathedrals. Our personal notion of time, our personal time horizons, clearly affect the way we decisions we make at our jobs
 * __Motivational packages__ People deliver what you measure them for. Quarterly EBITA figures are going to drive different behavior from the percentage of long-retention customers 

In my personal experience, people tend to take their personal time horizon for granted and wonder about how other could possibly be thinking differently. Comparing your personal sense of the future with the people around you can therefore be a truly enlightening experience.

__Key point:__ There is a range of perfectly valid reasons for people to consider wildly different time horizons when making decisions
 
## What does all of this mean for IT strategy?
So people perceive time differently and thus have differing opinions about whether a certain activity is sustainable or not. A very simple conclusion therefore must be that just stating that "we do xyz in a sustainable fashion" can mean vastly different things for different people. Which is not good for shared understanding. Which in turn is not good for strategy.

A more subtle impact is the question of strategy itself. As strategy also implies a notion of when some goals might be achieved, alignment of that time with the shared notion of "future" in the organization becomes important. If the "future" of the strategy is way beyond my "future", my commitment is probably going to be limited. A question arises of whether or not the strategy itself is sustainable _for me_, personally. Can I continue fulfilling the strategy for the future I can foresee for myself?

Finally, sustainability is a great way to tackle the problem of time horizons. These buggers pop up everywhere from financial planning to questions about workloads of people. A "time horizon" can be a fluffy concept to tackle but, as stated earlier, sustainability is something people tend to have intuitions for. Thus, conversations can be built and notions shared.


__Key point:__ Your strategy should explicitly contain some notion of time as time horizons are not necessarily implicitly shared
