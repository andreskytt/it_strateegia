## The paradox
There are a multitude of views of what the strategy is and is not, but it would be difficult to argue against the following statements about it

1. Strategy is dependent on both the organizational context and the organization itself. The organizations fundamentally create value out of relationships with external stakeholders using internal resources.
1. Strategy seeks to inflict a change in either the organization itself or its context. With no intention to change, developing a strategy would not be a very sensible exercise, would it?

Combining these two statements leads us to a familiar understanding of the dynamics of strategy. Our approach towards the world must change as the world changes. 

Looking deeper, however, a more complex result emerges. The success of a strategy lays arguably in the speed at which it moves an organization towards its targets. Assuming the same cost-benefit ratio, an approach that yields results in 6 months is arguably better, than the one taking a year. And any result probably means a change in the environment or the organization itself. The more ambitious the goal, the more profound the change and the better strategy is needed to get there.

Therefore, the better the strategy, the faster it becomes outdated.

Indeed, we seek to change the world around us but once the change is achieved, we need to learn to live in it. The challenger becomes the incumbent the faster the better they are at it. And the sooner they need to learn to fend of other attackers.

__Key point:__ the better the strategy, the faster it becomes outdated 

## Implications of the paradox
Any strategy implies structures and systems to support its execution. Once the strategy changes, for example because of loss of competitive advantage, these structures become liabilities[^1]. Although McGrath discusses this in the context of competitive advantage[^2], she clearly is right about the difficulty in transformation at the face of strategy change. A balance needs to be found: a deeper change in organization might allow for a better strategy that, once executed, would benefit from smaller changes to be able to transition to a new strategy. 

The second important implication has been described as the founder's dilemma[^4]. In the beginning, a strategy of a startup is nothing but an idea in the mind of the founder. In fact, the entire company is but a vision in her mind. As the company executes the strategy inflicting a change in the world, that initial strategy needs to develop, to be gradually replaced. But what if the founder is not capable of doing that since the strategy lives in _her_ head and that's not that easy to replace? Also, if the original idea was genius, how do you bring about a second one on cue?  

Even if the founder realizes the need for change, rapid success can strike (isn't that an odd expression?) too suddenly for the organization to react. In other words, companies become victims of their own success

__Key point:__ If you think you do not need an exit plan from your strategy, your strategy is not very good 

## Some examples
Let's consider Skype. Over the past 12 years, they came from nowhere and fundamentally changed the telecom business model. That happened in about 4 years. Over the remaining two thirds of the period, Skype has not ignited a similar technological or business change. Neither has there been a similar growth in terms of financial or user numbers[^5]. Skype intended to disrupt the telecom business and did so much faster than anybody anticipated. But it has found it difficult to create a strategy that sustains that success.

General Electric is another good example. Founded in 1878, the company has repeatedly shifted focus and strategy over the past 120 something years and is about to [do so again](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/28/technology/ge-the-124-year-old-software-start-up.html). This continued ability to change and shift indicates the presence of a, for lack of a better word, metastrategy that prevents the 300 000 people company from fossilizing. It might also be that GE's strategies are but moderately successful giving the company ample time to prepare for a change. For that to be the case for 100+ years, an underlying strategy of strategic thinking is probably necessary.

__Key point:__ Be careful with what you wish for. It might come true. Faster than you think.

[^2]: This is a whole other rabbit hole. While McGrath argues that it is in fact dangerous for companies to seek sustainable competitive advantages, Peter Thiel begs to differ. He does not sugar-coat it either stating bluntly that the competition is for losers[^3] and that truly great business should seek to build monopolies. Thiel certainly has been successful in his business endeavors but McGrath has a wider perspective stemming from here consulting experience. While interesting, comparing their positions would lead us too far from our main focus of technology strategy.

[^5]: As a former Skyper I do not intend to badmouth the company. Quite the contrary. This apparent lack of a winning strategy has not stopped Skype founders and investors making a very decent amount of money. _Their_ strategy was apparently spot on. The effects Skype has had on Estonian Startup ecosystem are lso difficult to overestimate.
