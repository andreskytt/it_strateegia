summary:    We examine key forces at play shaping any strategy. The OODA loop is introduced and a passing reference to seven levels of consciousness by Barrett is made. We also discuss the dynamics of people using Skype as an example.

## What about context?
It would be lovely, if we could just treat the strategy as our neat little subject of research with no messy external influence whatsoever. Unfortunately this is not so and any strategy necessarily applies in a context. We have already discussed the dynamic nature of strategy that, to an extent, stems from the dynamic nature of the world we live. In the following, we'll look at a few elements of that context more closely.

## The owner
From all the stakeholders, the owner is probably the most important one. After all, they finance the organization, it needs to fulfill some of their needs to justify existence. In other words, the organization needs to provide them some value. Otherwise, their money would probably be better spent elsewhere.  De Kluyver and Pearce[^1] define the key driver of the organization as  
<blockquote>
  <p>
	Creating value for owners and other stakeholders via providing value for the customers
  </p>
</blockquote>

Here it is crucial to understand that the concept of "value" is relative. Of course, in the world of financial management, value is usually represented as  dollar figures but that is a mere representation to allow for mathematics to work. In everyday life, value is a much more complex beast. For example, people who run small music studios or bars are not necessarily after financial rewards. For them, "value" resides in having a place to hang out with friends, play music or watch football. 

Ok, but what about the "other stakeholders"? Contrary to owners, who are rather well defined[^2], who are _these_ people? Well, in the modern world, that's pretty much everybody. Any institution of non-trivial scale probably finds itself in a web of relationships so global and complex that it would be difficult to argue for leaving anyone out of the "stakeholder" list. This creates a challenge: because there are many stakeholders there are many definitions of value. Thus a fundamental question of strategy is created: what exactly do we provide for whom and how do we know it constitutes value for them?

__Key point:__ The ability to provide value is a key driver of strategy but the definition of value is inherently subjective.
 
## The competition
Since its military roots, strategy has always concerned itself with winning, with overpowering somebody else. The competition. Although schools of thought exist that emphasize cooperation over competition and, indeed, modern complex value chains do support that view, conflict is always a given. Unless everybody shares the exact same needs and desires, there will always be groups of people with competing points of view. 

One of the most comprehensive models of dealing with competition comes from one John Boyd. He was a marvelous figure. An engineer by training, Boyd was a fighter pilot in Korean war and became a distinguished military strategist as his theories of aerial combat gained wider acceptance. He was known as "Forty Second Boyd" because of his standing bet that he could outmaneuver any opposing pilot within 40 seconds. It is not often somebody is able to develop a tactical approach, develop it to a strategic one and be able to see it both taught and executed[^3].

The key concept of Boyd's was the OODA loop consisting of following steps:
 1. Observation: the collection of data by means of the senses
 1. Orientation: the analysis and synthesis of data to form one's current mental perspective
 1. Decision: the determination of a course of action based on one's current mental perspective
 1. Action: the physical playing-out of decisions

After action has been taken, its results are to be observed and the cycle starts anew. In a competitive context, like aerial combat, the key is to be able to take these steps faster than the competitor. If one succeeds, the situation changes before the competitor is able to take action either paralyzing them in perpetual analysis or forcing them to take unsuitable action. 

Note how there are two distinct steps: gathering of data and synthesis of understanding. Often, the second step is neglected with decisions attempted based on the vast quantities of data available. But, as discussed previously, without an explicit mental model (the "current mental perspective" part) the numbers lack predictive properties.    

__Key point__: Being able to make better decisions faster, than the competition is a prerequisite of the ability to execute any strategy.

## The employees
Although internal to the organization[^4], strategies are usually developed by a small inner circle of thinkers and then communicated to the rest of the team. One of the best ways of doing this is by utilizing the Eisenhower quote we've already seen: plans are useless but planning is everything. Involving employees in the all stages of strategy development would at least ensure they are informed of the outcome as well as the thought processes behind them. This does not, however, mean agreement. Fundamentally, for a mutually beneficial cooperation stems from aligned strategic interests (also, remember the part about defining value). Of course, understanding is necessary for that alignment to be there but not sufficient. 

Organizations are made of people and people do change. This can create interesting strategic challenges for organizations. For example, Skype at some point hired a lot of young talented people from Tallinn who worked hard and played hard together. It was an extraordinarily close group of people. And what happens when like-minded young people spend a lot of time together? Love. Marriage. Children. Thus, at a certain point there was a sudden explosion of "Skype kids": children born to Skyper parents. But strategic goals of a single twentysomething are very different from these of a young father or mother. And so, a few years into its stellar ride,  Skype saw a sudden significant change in group dynamic in its engineering team just as its own strategy was challenged by its own success. 

On a very fundamental level, our individual goals in life are tightly related to our personal values. Richard Barret divides these into seven levels of consciousness[^5]:

 1. Survival
 1. Relationship
 1. Self-esteem
 1. Transformation
 1. Internal cohesion
 1. Making a difference
 1. Service

The exact meaning of these is definitely worthy of individual exploration but the key point is thus: On the 4th level of development a person leaves back its ego, is capable of facing its errors and accept lack of control. Control, however, is a central concept in strategy: historically military strategy sought to gain control over situations until the problems at hand grew too complex and the idea of dynamic competences or a learning organization emerged [^6]. Therefore, certain strategies assume certain values. Learning is not viable when most employees focus on survival. 

__Key point__: It is not sufficient to communicate a strategy: it must also be executable by  the members of the organization within the applicable time-frame

I've seen a large IT unit where more than half of the people in the office were contractors. This creates an additional layer of complexity to strategy execution too interesting to go into detail here
