summary:    In order to successfully discuss technology strategy or, more generally, technology in organizational context, it would be helpful to have a mental model that unifies various aspects of an organization. We look at how systems engineering can help in developing such a model, bring an example and utilize that to discuss questions of IT and business alignment and the role of technology in an enterprise.

## What is "business"?
This one started, yet again, from a conversation I had the other day. After a lengthy discussion about how I think of organizational architecture, the other party interrupted me by saying something along the lines "What do you mean, when you say 'business'? With us, everybody is measured against product goals and everybody can influence product direction. So where's the business?" 

A most excellent question. The company we discussed is well run by all indicators and attributes this ability to a large extent to this ability to focus on the product[^1]. How does it fit with the notion of a distinct IT strategy and the conventional view of IT-business alignment?

__Key point:__ In order to discuss it-business alignment we must first have a clear notion of what each of them is.

## Model of an organization

### A bit of theory
This would appear to be a question fitting neatly into the domain of system architecture that concerns itself with how things fit together to be more useful than the individual pieces. In that field, all systems are thought to have three different aspects, if you will. Form, function and concept. Function is what the system _does_, while form is what the system _is_. Since the same function can be implemented by several configurations of form (there's a myriad of seating implements out there) and vice versa, a third idea of concept is introduced that embodies the particular way of thinking leading to this particular relationship between form and function.

One way of distinguishing between the three is to think of the business structure: if somebody would be paying for something, it's function. If it costs money, it's probably form. And if neither is true, you are likely to be looking at concept[^2]

### Enterprise architecture
We might get this one out of the way early. There is a discipline called "Enterprise Architecture" that does deal with the architecture of enterprise-wide information systems[^3]. This is decidedly not what I mean. For me, enterprise architecture is the architecture of the enterprise that might or might not involve any information systems at all. 

With that, how can we utilize the theory to have a framework for real enterprise architecture?

Seeing organizations as executing a structured set of value-creating functions is not very controversial. So that setup of those functions gives us the "function" part. The form of a modern organization can be described in various ways but, if our model is supposed to be usable for managerial tasks, we should seek to draw boundaries based on competences or responsibilities. By doing that we get to peopleware (the domain of managers and HR professionals), software (the domain of software engineers) and hardware (the domain of non-software engineering folks[^4]). 

Finally the concept. One way to look at this is organizational culture that defines key modes of thinking about an organization by its members. But strategy itself also seeks to be part of the process of mapping a solution to a functional requirement and is thus part of the concept. In general, let's call this layer "Business". This is where key questions about "how shall we approach this problem" get answered either explicitly or implicitly.

The software people like layers. So it would make sense to place the elements we discussed into a layered model. Software folks also like systematic approaches so let's arrange the layers in terms of their distance from the concerns for the actual physical world. Behold the Enterprise Architecture Model:

__Key point:__ The ideas of system engineering can be used to develop a layered model of organizational architecture

## Back to the question
So now there's this enterprise architecture model. What about it? Well, firstly it answers the question of "what is the business?". The business is the part of the organization that defines the key mental models the members of the organization use when implementing solutions to problems in their working lives. 

Secondly, the model provides a usable way of discussing that "thin" setup where strategic decisions are very close to the technical ones. Looking at the diagram above we can think of that sort of a startup-like company as having the layers be very thin and well-integrated. That way, a change in one layer propagates easily to others and their impact to a variety of aspects of an organization can be judged with relative ease. Also, various layers have good visibility into the challenges of others and can thus contribute to their resolution. 

Bear in mind, though, that the laws of gravity as implied by model's theoretical foundation still apply. Since the mental models used define the form we build to solve problems[^5], decisions tend to flow downwards more easily than they do upwards. The network guy can have valuable strategic insight but it is likely to be challenged and tested to a larger extent than ideas of the CEO. There is also the question of responsibility. Regardless of the quality of cooperation, division of labor still makes sense: each of us have their own strengths and competences that make us more or less suitable for taking responsibility in any of the layers.

![Two examples of different organizations]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/ffc_ex.png)

It is important to note that neither of the organizational designs is preferable to the other: they each have different uses and can be successful. A taller organization has more inertia and thus probably scales better and is more resistant to be swayed by a sudden turbulence. A thin approach allows to faster  change, more control but probably has more difficulty scaling. As there is no good or bad strategy there is no good or bad enterprise architecture, just architecture that either supports or does not support what we are trying to achieve.

Finally, the question of it-business alignment becomes the question of alignment between the layers. A good alignment has the structure of different layers lining up (it is sub-optimal to have a team be distributed across various office locations, an mis-alignment of organizational and hardware layers). Also, the layers should be equally well-developed and of similar length (a powerful system capable of providing much more functions that is currently monetized is not a waste of resources).
 
__Key point:__ The theoretical organizational architecture framework developed can be used to provide mental models and metaphors to think of various organizational challenges
