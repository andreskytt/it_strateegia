This blog contains companion content for the IT Strategy course I teach at the Tallinn University. The course is structured around key competences of an IT manager and is intended to provide mental models and core understanding rather than a specific approach to developing a strategy for the IT organisation.

The latest release of the lecture slides and a document containing all the content published here is available in [github](https://github.com/andreskytt/it_strateegia/releases/latest) 

A Jekyll theme crafted with <3 by [John Otander](http://johnotander.com)
([@4lpine](https://twitter.com/4lpine)) is used.
